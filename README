This set of classes is a lucene implementation of the SPUD retrieval 
model that appears in "A Polya Urn Document Language Model for 
Improved Information Retrieval" by Ronan Cummins, Jiaul Hoque Paik, 
and Yuanhua Lv, and the pseudo-relevance query expansion approach to building 
"Query Topic Models" in the paper "Improved Query Topic Models via
Pseudo-Relevant Polya Document Models" by Ronan Cummins.

All of the expansion methods in the paper are implemented here. 
Hopefully all are implemented correctly. Notifications of bugs welcome. 



The classes depend on the following publicly available jar files:

lucene-core-5.0.0.jar
lucene-queryparser-5.0.0.jar
lucene-analyzers-common-5.0.0.jar
lucene-queries-5.0.0.jar
commons-math3-3.3.jar
jsoup-1.7.3.jar



The only two classes with main methods are:
indexing.LuceneTRECIndexer
searching.QuerySearch

You will need to re-index documents as the contents of the documents 
are stored in a seperate lucene index. This increases speed of retrieval 
and expansion. 

All the methods for query expansion are in QueryExpansion.java
